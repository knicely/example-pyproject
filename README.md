This is a readme file for example-pyproject. This is just starting out. IDK what else to put in here. This file is a placeholder. For now. 

Here's a great science joke: 
Einstein, Newton, and Pascal are playing hide and seek. It's Einstein's turn to seek. 
He counts to ten, opens his eyes, and sees that Newton is standing in front of him. 
Confused, Einstein says, "Newton, I found you!" 
Newton shakes his head, pointing at the ground where he's drawn a one meter by one meter box around him. "No, you've found Pascal!"
